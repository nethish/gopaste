# gopaste - A utility to paste clipboard contents to a file
* `gopaste file.txt` will create a new file `file.txt` and paste the contents of the clipboard to it

## Motivation
I do lot of experiments and often copy paste code from stack overflow or ChatGPT. Every time I start a new project, create files and paste contents to it.
It was slow and annoying (well for me it was).
